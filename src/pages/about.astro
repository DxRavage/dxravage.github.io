            Hello there! Around 18 years ago i got access to a computer for the
            fist time when my grandad got a laptop to write content for his
            newspapper from home.
            <p>
              Initially, I learned to use software like Word to assist with our
              family business. However, I soon discovered the endless
              possibilities computers offered beyond simple word processing,
              starting with a copy of Age of Mythology, my parthner back then
              Visual Boy Advanced that i used to play Pokemon Emerald countless
              times all the way to World of Warcraft a couple years after that.
            </p>
            <p>
              Messed around a little with linux distros like Debian and Arch
              back then. Now a 27 years old Mexican Software Engineer with a
              taste for web development, commited to deliver great user
              experience trough web optimization and responsive design.
              <p>
                Currently into component-based languages such as Astro, React
                also using Tailwind CSS, got a like into it for the ability to
                streamline development and great code reusability. Strongly
                believe all this and everything i done so far is what makes me
                who i am today.
              </p>
