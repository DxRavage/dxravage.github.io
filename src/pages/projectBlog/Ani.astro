    description:
      "My approach began with a user-first design in Figma, where I created a clean, intuitive interface that prioritizes content discovery and accessibility. I then translated this design into a high-performance web application using **Astro's island architecture** to minimize JavaScript and ensure lightning-fast load times. The visual design was meticulously implemented with **Tailwind CSS**, focusing on a responsive, component-driven layout that adapts seamlessly to any device. This disciplined workflow, from detailed mockups to a production-ready build, highlights my ability to deliver a polished, modern, and highly performant front-end product that puts the user's experience first.",
