    description:
      "The primary challenge in this project was recreating the intricate, content-heavy layout of the original website while maintaining performance and responsiveness. By using **Astro's static site generation**, the site is pre-rendered into simple HTML, drastically reducing load times. **Tailwind CSS** was instrumental in replicating the design details efficiently and ensuring the layout adapted flawlessly to different screen sizes. This project served as an excellent exercise in translating a complex visual design into a clean, modern, and performant web experience.",
