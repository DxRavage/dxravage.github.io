      "The design process began with a deep focus on the end-user. Through user research and wireframing, I identified the key needs of both current students and new visitors. The goal was to create a simple, effective interface that minimizes friction. Using Figma, I created a component-based design system to ensure consistency and a cohesive user experience across all screens. The result is a clean, intuitive app that puts the user's needs at the forefront, making it easy to connect with the dojo.",
